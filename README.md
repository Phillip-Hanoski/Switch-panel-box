In this repository I included all the design and coding files.
The scheamtic pdf, the actual altium project and even the solidworks file of the bottom of the box that was 3D printed.
To use the box simply connect your computer to the arduino and upload the arduino code (realsketchbuttoncode.ino) to the arduino and it should be good to go.
To use the box without having to push the button make sure the adruino code is uploaded and then read the commenting of the python code
(realSwitchBoxpythoncode.py) which gives detailed instructions on how to use the code.
