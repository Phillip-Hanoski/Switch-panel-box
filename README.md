In this repository, I included all the design and coding files.
The schematic pdf, the actual Altium project, and even the Solidworks file of the bottom of the box that was 3D printed.
To use the box, simply connect your computer to the Arduino and upload the Arduino code (realsketchbuttoncode.ino). Then, you should be good to go.
To use the box without pushing the button, please make sure the Arduino code is uploaded and then close the Arduino IDE as it will fight with the Python 
code over the serial port. Furthermore, read the commenting on the Python code (realSwitchBoxpythoncode.py), which gives simple instructions on 
using the code.
